# AI Pet Image Generator (Stable Diffusion + DreamBooth Project)

This is a personal learning project where I explored **Stable Diffusion** and **DreamBooth fine-tuning** for AI image generation.  
I focused on generating **Pixar-style pet images**, training a custom model and experimenting with different prompts, styles, and techniques.

---

## What I Did

✅ Trained a **Stable Diffusion model** using **DreamBooth** on pet images  
✅ Studied how **diffusion models** and **fine-tuning** processes work  
✅ Experimented with **prompt engineering** to improve output style and quality  
✅ Generated and analyzed **hundreds of AI pet images**  
✅ Tuned training parameters to achieve better **style consistency**

## What I Learned

🧠 **How Stable Diffusion and DreamBooth work** — model architecture, denoising process, fine-tuning workflow  
🎨 **How to control output style** through training and prompts  
🛠️ **How training parameters impact model quality**  
🚀 **How to approach building a real-world AI product** from these tools  
⚠️ **Challenges and limitations** — dataset quality, style consistency, generalization

## Why This Matters

✅ Shows initiative — I took on an advanced AI/ML project outside of coursework  
✅ Shows technical curiosity — I worked to deeply understand the model and process  
✅ Shows creativity — applying AI to a unique, fun, and marketable idea  
✅ Shows product thinking — considering how to turn this into a real product for users

## Example Results

| Prompt | Result |
|--------|--------|
| "Golden retriever, Pixar style, happy, stars in background" | ![Example](outputs/example_1.png) |
| "Cat in Zootopia style, sitting with flowers" | ![Example](outputs/example_2.png) |

## Next Steps

- Improve training with more diverse, high-quality data  
- Experiment with **LoRA** and **ControlNet** for better results  
- Prototype a **simple web app** for user uploads and pet image generation
