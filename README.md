# 🐾 AI Pet Image Generator (Stable Diffusion + DreamBooth)

This project explores the use of **Stable Diffusion 3.5** combined with **DreamBooth fine-tuning** to generate highly stylized, **Pixar-inspired pet portraits**.  
The goal was to build a consistent image generation pipeline that could produce **high-quality, stylistically uniform pet images**.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

While experimenting with **MidJourney**, I found that although it produced great images, it struggled with **consistency** — even when using the same prompt, the style and composition would vary significantly between generations.  

I wanted to build my own **custom-trained model** that could:  
✅ Produce images in a **controlled, repeatable style**  
✅ Better match the aesthetic I was targeting (Pixar-inspired)  
✅ Be run locally for **full control and faster iteration**  

This led me to explore **Stable Diffusion** and **DreamBooth fine-tuning** for my own use case.

## ✨ Project Highlights

✅ Fine-tuned **Stable Diffusion 3.5** using **DreamBooth** on a curated pet image dataset  
✅ Used **Google Colab** ☁️ for efficient cloud-based model training  
✅ Imported the trained model and deployed it locally using **Automatic1111 Web UI** 🖥️  
✅ Built an **end-to-end pipeline**: cloud training → local inference → image generation and evaluation  
✅ Applied **prompt engineering** 📝 to refine style, consistency, and image quality
