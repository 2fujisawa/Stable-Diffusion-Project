# AI Pet Image Generator (Stable Diffusion + DreamBooth)

This project explores the use of **Stable Diffusion 3.5** combined with **DreamBooth fine-tuning** to generate highly stylized, Pixar-inspired pet portraits.  
The goal was to understand how to fine-tune large diffusion models on a custom dataset, and how to run a complete **end-to-end image generation pipeline**.

I trained a custom model using **Google Colab** and DreamBooth techniques, then imported the model to my **local machine** to perform optimized image generation.  
This process allowed me to better understand both **cloud-based training** and **local deployment** of AI models.

## Project Highlights

- Fine-tuned **Stable Diffusion 3.5** using **DreamBooth** on a curated pet image dataset  
- Used **Google Colab** for efficient cloud-based model training  
- Imported the trained model to **local environment** for faster, optimized inference  
- Built a functional pipeline: **cloud training → local inference → image generation and evaluation**  
- Applied **prompt engineering** techniques to refine style, consistency, and image quality

## Key Skills and Learnings

- Understanding of **Stable Diffusion architecture** and **DreamBooth fine-tuning** workflows  
- Experience with **managing models across cloud and local environments**  
- Setting up **Stable Diffusion for local use**, including handling dependencies and performance optimization  
- Practical knowledge of **prompt tuning** and **style transfer**  
- Exposure to **AI product workflows**, from raw training data to usable outputs

## Future Work

- Further improve style consistency through advanced fine-tuning (LoRA, ControlNet)  
- Experiment with **larger datasets** and more complex styles  
- Prototype a **simple front-end** for user-driven pet image generation  
- Optimize pipeline for **scalability and production readiness**
